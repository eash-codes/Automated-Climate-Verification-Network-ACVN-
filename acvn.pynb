False claims about global warming, renewable energy, and climate science confuse people and slow down action. This project fights back.\n\nI built a smart AI system that automatically:\n- **Catches** false or misleading climate claims\n- **Verifies** them against real scientific sources (NASA, IPCC, NOAA)\n- **Explains** why they're wrong with evidence\n- **Creates** shareable counter-narratives for social media\n- **Generates** professional reports (PDF + JSON)\n\nThink of it as a fact-checking robot trained specifically for climate misinformation.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nEvery day, millions see posts like:\n- \"Climate change is a hoax invented by China\"\n- \"Solar panels pollute more than they help\"\n- \"Arctic ice is actually increasing\"\n- \"A few degrees of warming won't hurt\"\n\nThese claims sound plausible but they're **scientifically wrong**. The problem? There's no automated system to debunk them at scale across social media.\n\n---\n\n## The Solution: 5 AI Agents Working Together\n\nInstead of one big AI trying to do everything, I created 5 specialized agents. Each one is really good at one job:\n\n| Agent          |             Job        |                Example Output                |\n|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** 🔍 | Detects climate claims | \"This is climate denial, needs verification\" |\n| **Agent 2** ✓ | Verifies against sources | \"FALSE - contradicts NASA data\" |\n| **Agent 3** 📚 | Writes fact-checks | \"Why this claim is wrong: ...\" |\n| **Agent 4** ⭐ | Scores credibility | \"23/100 - Highly unreliable\" |\n| **Agent 5** 📱 | Makes social posts | \"🚫 Myth: ... REALITY: ... #FactCheck\" |\n\nEach agent passes its output to the next. The final result? A complete fact-check package ready to share.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works (The Flow)\n\n\n1. Raw Climate Claim (from news, Reddit, Twitter)\n2. Agent 1: Detect & Classify\n3. Agent 2: Verify Against Sources\n4. Agent 3: Synthesize Evidence\n5. Agent 4: Calculate Score\n6.
