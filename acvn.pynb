False claims about global warming, renewable energy, and climate science confuse people and slow down action. This project fights back.\n\nI built a smart AI system that automatically:\n- **Catches** false or misleading climate claims\n- **Verifies** them against real scientific sources (NASA, IPCC, NOAA)\n- **Explains** why they're wrong with evidence\n- **Creates** shareable counter-narratives for social media\n- **Generates** professional reports (PDF + JSON)\n\nThink of it as a fact-checking robot trained specifically for climate misinformation.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nEvery day, millions see posts like:\n- \"Climate change is a hoax invented by China\"\n- \"Solar panels pollute more than they help\"\n- \"Arctic ice is actually increasing\"\n- \"A few degrees of warming won't hurt\"\n\nThese claims sound plausible but they're **scientifically wrong**. The problem? There's no automated system to debunk them at scale across social media.\n\n---\n\n## The Solution: 5 AI Agents Working Together\n\nInstead of one big AI trying to do everything, I created 5 specialized agents. Each one is really good at one job:\n\n| Agent          |             Job        |                Example Output                |\n|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Agent 1** 🔍 | Detects climate claims | \"This is climate denial, needs verification\" |\n| **Agent 2** ✓ | Verifies against sources | \"FALSE - contradicts NASA data\" |\n| **Agent 3** 📚 | Writes fact-checks | \"Why this claim is wrong: ...\" |\n| **Agent 4** ⭐ | Scores credibility | \"23/100 - Highly unreliable\" |\n| **Agent 5** 📱 | Makes social posts | \"🚫 Myth: ... REALITY: ... #FactCheck\" |\n\nEach agent passes its output to the next. The final result? A complete fact-check package ready to share.\n\n---\n\n## How It Works (The Flow)\n\n\n1. Raw Climate Claim (from news, Reddit, Twitter)\n2. Agent 1: Detect & Classify\n3. Agent 2: Verify Against Sources\n4. Agent 3: Synthesize Evidence\n5. Agent 4: Calculate Score\n6.

CLAIM: Electric vehicles have a greater negative environmental impact than ga...\n   📋 Type: misleading_data\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 90%\n   🔗 Sources: EPA, International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), European Environment Agency (EEA)\n   💡 Explanation: Lifecycle assessments consistently show that electric vehicles (EVs) have a lower overall environmental impact than gasoline-powered cars, particularly concerning greenhouse gas emissions. Although EV battery production is energy-intensive, these upfront emissions are typically offset within a few years of driving due to zero tailpipe emissions and a progressively cleaner electricity grid, leading to lower lifetime environmental footprints.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n2. CLAIM: Solar panels cause a net increase in pollution over their entire lifec...\n   📋 Type: misleading_data\n   ✓ VERDICT: MISLEADING\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 98%\n   🔗 Sources: IPCC, NASA, NOAA\n   💡 Explanation: While solar panel manufacturing has an environmental footprint, numerous lifecycle assessments consistently show that the clean energy produced over their 25-30 year lifespan far offsets these initial emissions and other pollutants, resulting in a significant net reduction in overall pollution compared to fossil fuel electricity generation.\n   🎯 Confidence: 0.95\n\n3. CLAIM: Nuclear power plants cause more deaths than coal...\n   📋 Type: misleading_data\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 95%\n   🔗 Sources: Public Health Organizations (e.g., WHO for air pollution impacts), Energy Research Institutions, Academic studies on energy mortality rates\n   💡 Explanation: The claim that nuclear power plants cause more deaths than coal is false. Scientific studies consistently demonstrate that coal power is responsible for significantly more deaths per unit of energy produced compared to nuclear power. This disparity is primarily driven by the severe health impacts of air pollution from coal combustion, which far outweigh the mortality risks associated with nuclear energy, even when accounting for major accidents.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n4. CLAIM: Planting trees alone is sufficient to stop climate change....\n   📋 Type: exaggeration\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 97%\n   🔗 Sources: NASA, IPCC, NOAA\n   💡 Explanation: Planting trees is a vital part of climate change mitigation by sequestering carbon, but it is not sufficient on its own to stop climate change. Climate change is primarily driven by extensive greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels across multiple sectors, which tree planting alone cannot offset. Scientific consensus indicates that a comprehensive approach involving deep cuts in emissions across all sectors, alongside carbon removal strategies including afforestation, is necessary to effectively address climate change.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n5. CLAIM: Arctic ice is increasing...\n   📋 Type: climate_denial\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 100%\n   🔗 Sources: NSIDC, IPCC, NASA, NOAA\n   💡 Explanation: The claim that Arctic ice is increasing is false. Scientific observations from organizations like the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) consistently show that Arctic sea ice is rapidly declining. This decline is a clear indicator of global warming, with Arctic sea ice extent decreasing at an average rate of 13% per decade.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n6. CLAIM: Climate models have never been accurate...\n   📋 Type: climate_denial\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 97%\n   🔗 Sources: IPCC, NASA, NOAA\n   💡 Explanation: The claim that climate models have never been accurate is false. Numerous studies have demonstrated that climate models, especially those projecting long-term global temperature trends, have been largely consistent with observed changes. While models have uncertainties, their predictions of global mean warming and other large-scale climate changes have been remarkably accurate.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n7. CLAIM: Volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans...\n   📋 Type: misleading_data\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 97%\n   🔗 Sources: NASA, IPCC, NOAA\n   💡 Explanation: The claim is false. Scientific data consistently show that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, emit over 50 times more CO2 annually than all volcanic emissions combined. This makes human emissions the primary driver of the observed rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 and the consequent global warming.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n8. CLAIM: A few degrees of global warming will not have a significant impact or ...\n   📋 Type: climate_denial\n   ✓ VERDICT: FALSE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 97%\n   🔗 Sources: IPCC, NASA, NOAA, NSIDC\n   💡 Explanation: The claim is false because even the current 1.1°C of global warming has led to significant, observable impacts, including increased extreme weather, sea-level rise, and ice melt. A further increase of 'a few degrees' would intensify these and many other dangerous effects, posing substantial risks to natural systems and human well-being.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n\n9. CLAIM: CO2 is a greenhouse gas...\n   📋 Type: factual\n   ✓ VERDICT: TRUE\n   📊 Scientific Consensus: 100%\n   🔗 Sources: NASA, IPCC\n   💡 Explanation: CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, a fundamental concept in physics established since the 1800s. It functions by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n   🎯 Confidence: 1.00\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 6: Agent 3 - The Evidence Synthesizer\n\nAgent 2 found the truth.

Fact Check: Do Electric Vehicles Have a Greater Negative Environmental Impact Than Gasoline Cars? NO.\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: Claims that electric vehicles (EVs) are worse for the environment than gasoline cars are false. Extensive scientific studies consistently show that EVs produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions over their entire lifespan, including manufacturing and operation, compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.\n   Bottom Line: Electric vehicles are a more environmentally friendly transportation option than gasoline cars. While their manufacturing has an initial carbon footprint, their lower operational emissions, especially as grids become cleaner, result in a significantly reduced overall negative environmental impact over their lifespan.\n   Citations: 3 sources\n\n2. Fact Check: Solar Panels Do Not Cause a Net Increase in Pollution Over Their Lifecycle\n   Verdict: MISLEADING\n   Summary: The claim that solar panels cause a net increase in pollution over their entire lifecycle is misleading. Scientific lifecycle assessments consistently demonstrate that solar panels prevent significantly more greenhouse gas emissions and pollution during their operation than are produced during their manufacturing and disposal. They generate more clean energy in just 1-4 years than the energy consumed to produce them.\n   Bottom Line: While solar panel production has an environmental footprint, rigorous scientific assessments confirm that their long-term operation results in a substantial net reduction of greenhouse gases and pollution, making them a critical tool in combating climate change.\n   Citations: 3 sources\n\n3. Fact Check: Nuclear Power Plants Do Not Cause More Deaths Than Coal\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: The claim that nuclear power plants cause more deaths than coal is false. Scientific studies consistently demonstrate that coal power generation is significantly more lethal due to the pervasive health impacts of air pollution, while nuclear power has a remarkably low mortality rate per unit of energy produced.\n   Bottom Line: The scientific evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the claim: coal power is vastly more deadly than nuclear power, primarily due to the severe health impacts of its air pollution.\n   Citations: 3 sources\n\n4. Fact Check: No, Planting Trees Alone Is Not Enough to Stop Climate Change\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: While tree planting is a crucial and beneficial climate action, it is not sufficient on its own to halt global warming. The scale of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from burning fossil fuels, is too vast for trees alone to counteract. A comprehensive strategy involving deep emissions cuts across all sectors is essential.\n   Bottom Line: Planting trees is a valuable component of climate action, but it is not a standalone solution. Stopping climate change requires urgent, deep, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from all human activities, complemented by efforts to protect and restore natural ecosystems.\n   Citations: 3 sources\n\n5. Fact Check: Arctic Ice Is Decreasing, Not Increasing\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: The claim that Arctic ice is increasing is false. Scientific data from multiple reputable organizations consistently shows that Arctic sea ice extent is rapidly declining, not growing. This decline is a critical indicator of global climate change.\n   Bottom Line: The scientific consensus is clear: Arctic sea ice is rapidly decreasing, not increasing, serving as a critical indicator of ongoing climate change.\n   Citations: 2 sources\n\n6. Climate Models Prove Accurate: Real-World Observations Confirm Projections\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: The claim that 'climate models have never been accurate' is false. Decades of scientific modeling have consistently and accurately predicted key climate indicators, including global temperature rise, sea level increase, and Arctic sea ice melt. These projections are strongly supported by observed data from leading scientific organizations worldwide.\n   Bottom Line: Climate models have a strong and validated track record of accuracy, with observed climate change matching or in some cases exceeding their projections, solidifying their role as reliable tools for understanding our changing planet.\n   Citations: 5 sources\n\n7. Fact Check: Human CO2 Emissions Vastly Outpace Volcanoes\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: The claim that volcanoes emit more CO2 than humans is false. Scientific data clearly shows that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, release over 100 times more CO2 into the atmosphere annually than all volcanoes combined. It's human-caused emissions that are driving current climate change.\n   Bottom Line: The scientific evidence is clear: human activities are by far the largest source of CO2 emissions, dwarfing those from volcanoes, and are the primary cause of current global warming.\n   Citations: 3 sources\n\n8. Fact Check: Even A Few Degrees of Global Warming Has Significant Impacts\n   Verdict: FALSE\n   Summary: The claim that a few degrees of global warming will not have a significant impact or will make no difference is false. Scientific data shows that even the current 1.1°C increase has already led to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and rapid ice loss. These observable changes demonstrate profound and widespread consequences for our planet, disproving the idea that minor warming is negligible.\n   Bottom Line: Even a seemingly small increase of a few degrees in global average temperature leads to widespread, severe, and increasingly irreversible impacts on Earth's systems, making the claim that it's insignificant unequivocally false.\n   Citations: 4 sources\n\n9. Fact Check: Yes, CO2 is a Greenhouse Gas\n   Verdict: TRUE\n   Summary: The claim that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas is TRUE. CO2 molecules absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, effectively trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere.

However, individual storms like Melissa are complex events influenced by numerous natural atmospheric and oceanic factors. Scientific attribution focuses on how climate change *changes the probability or intensity* of such events, not on *solely causing* any single one. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurate climate communication. #FactCheck #ClimateReality #ScienceMatters', 'facebook_long': '**Was Hurricane Melissa \\'climate-change-driven\\'? Let\\'s unpack this common, yet misleading, claim.**\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to point to a powerful storm like Hurricane Melissa and say, \"That\\'s climate change!\" And it\\'s true that our planet\\'s warming trend significantly impacts hurricanes. However, the claim that any *single* hurricane is *solely* \"climate-change-driven\" is a crucial oversimplification that misrepresents climate science.\\n\\n**Here\\'s the scientific reality:**\\nClimate change is indeed a supercharger for hurricanes. Warmer ocean waters provide more energy, leading to stronger storms. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing potential rainfall and flooding. These factors contribute to an observable trend of more intense, rapidly intensifying, and wetter hurricanes globally. The IPCC, NASA, and NOAA consistently report on this increase in overall hurricane intensity and frequency of extreme events due to global warming.\\n\\nBut here\\'s where the nuance comes in: Every individual hurricane, including Melissa, is also a product of complex natural atmospheric and oceanic variability. Factors like wind shear, ocean currents, and specific weather patterns play critical roles in their formation, track, and intensity. Scientists use sophisticated attribution studies to determine how climate change *influences the probability or intensity* of certain weather events, rather than claiming absolute causation for any single event. Think of it like this: climate change loads the dice, making extreme outcomes more likely and more severe, but it doesn\\'t *roll* every specific number.\\n\\nClaiming a single storm is \"solely\" climate-change-driven can lead to an incomplete understanding of both climate science and the complex nature of weather systems. It risks creating a false dichotomy where either a storm is *all* climate change or *none* of it, when the truth is a dynamic interplay.\\n\\n**Why this distinction matters:** Accurate communication helps us understand the true scope of climate impact and develop effective strategies for resilience and mitigation. Let\\'s rely on robust science to guide our conversations and actions.\\n\\n**What you can do:**\\n1. Share this post to help others understand the nuance.\\n2. Visit reputable science sources like IPCC, NASA, NOAA to learn more about hurricane science and climate change.\\n3.

While global warming intensifies hurricanes overall, making them stronger & wetter, attributing a *single* storm *solely* to climate change is misleading. Natural atmospheric variability still plays a huge role in individual storms. Think of climate change as loading the dice, not rolling every specific outcome. 🎲 #ClimateScience #HurricaneMelissa #FactCheck #ScienceMatters #ClimateLiteracy\\n\\n✨ Understand the science, share the facts! ✨ Save this post for later and share with friends!\", 'linkedin_professional': '**Navigating Climate Attribution: Was Hurricane Melissa \"Climate-Change-Driven?\"**\\n\\nIn discussions around climate impacts, the attribution of specific extreme weather events to climate change is a common point of contention. The assertion that a single event, such as \"Hurricane Melissa was climate-change-driven,\" while intuitively appealing, oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors at play and misrepresents the current scientific consensus.\\n\\n**Scientific Nuance vs. Simplistic Attribution:**\\nGlobal warming undeniably provides the thermodynamic conditions conducive to more intense hurricanes: warmer ocean waters fuel storm strength, and increased atmospheric moisture leads to heavier rainfall (IPCC AR6 WG1). Observational data, supported by climate models, indicates a global increase in the proportion of intense tropical cyclones and their rapid intensification rates.\\n\\nHowever, the formation and trajectory of any individual hurricane, including Hurricane Melissa, are also profoundly shaped by natural atmospheric and oceanic variability—factors like ENSO cycles, Madden-Julian Oscillation, and localized wind shear. Attribution science, as practiced by leading institutions like NOAA and NASA, focuses on quantifying how climate change alters the *probability* or *intensity* of certain types of events, rather than establishing absolute causation for a unique storm. It\\'s about changing the odds, not dictating every outcome.\\n\\n**Implications for Policy and Communication:**\\nMisrepresenting this scientific nuance can hinder effective policy development and climate communication. Oversimplification can lead to either exaggerated claims that fuel skepticism or an incomplete understanding of risk. A precise understanding of attribution allows for more targeted adaptation strategies and a clearer articulation of the urgency for mitigation. It underscores that while specific events have natural roots, their characteristics and impacts are increasingly modulated by anthropogenic climate change.\\n\\n**Key takeaway:** While climate change is a critical factor influencing the *characteristics and likelihood* of hurricanes globally, attributing a *single* storm *solely* to climate change is an inaccurate oversimplification of complex meteorological and climatological processes.\\n\\n#ClimateScience #Attribution #Meteorology #ClimateChange #ScientificLiteracy #IPCC #NOAA #NASA\\n\\n[Visit IPCC for AR6 WG1 report: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/]\\n[Explore NOAA\\'s Climate.gov for more: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/tropical-cyclones-and-climate-change]', 'tiktok_script': 'NARRATOR: Was Hurricane Melissa caused by climate change?! \\n\\n[0-3s] HOOK: *Dramatic music, quick cut of hurricane imagery.* \"Was Hurricane Melissa caused by climate change?!\"\\n\\n[3-8s] MAIN POINT 1 (Misconception): *Cut to creator looking thoughtful, perhaps shaking head.* \"Actually, saying one storm like Melissa was *solely* \\'climate-change-driven\\' is MISLEADING.\" *Text overlay: \"MISLEADING!\"*\\n\\n[8-15s] MAIN POINT 2 (Reality): *Graphic showing warmer oceans, more moisture.* \"Here\\'s the science: Climate change makes hurricanes stronger & wetter *overall*.
