    "- \"Climate change is a hoax invented by China\"\n",
    "- \"Solar panels pollute more than they help\"\n",
    "- \"Arctic ice is actually increasing\"\n",

Numerous studies have shown that climate models, including early ones, have successfully predicted global temperature trends and other climate changes that have since been observed. While models have uncertainties and are constantly refined, they are indispensable and largely accurate tools for understanding and projecting climate change.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is mission control. The Orchestrator is like a conductor leading a symphony of 5 AI agents, each playing their part in perfect harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "1. **Takes in raw claims** (like \"Climate change is a hoax\")\n",
    "2. **Runs them through Agent 1** → Claims get classified\n",
    "3. **Passes to Agent 2** → Claims get fact-checked\n",
    "4. **Sends to Agent 3** → Evidence gets synthesized\n",
    "5. **Goes to Agent 4** → Credibility scores calculated\n",
    "6. **Finally to Agent 5** → Counter-narratives generated\n",
    "7. **Compiles everything** into one comprehensive report\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Complete Pipeline:**\n",
    "Raw Claims → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Agent 4 → Agent 5 → Final Report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it outputs:**\n",
    "- A complete JSON report with ALL agent outputs preserved (nothing gets lost)\n",
    "- Summary statistics (how many true/false, average credibility)\n",
    "- Timestamp of when it was generated\n",
    "- System configuration used\n",
    "- Ready to be saved or displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Sequential execution (each agent feeds into the next)\n",
    "- Error handling (skips failed claims gracefully)\n",
    "- Full transparency (you can see what each agent did)\n",
    "- Exportable reports (saves to JSON for later use or PDF generation)\n",
    "- Beautiful summary display (human-readable results)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like an assembly line: raw materials go in one end, a finished product comes out the other. 🏭\n"

    "Now we're getting real data from the actual internet. This scraper finds actual climate-related claims from news sources so we can fact-check what people are actually saying right now.\n",

    "**What it does:**\n",
    "- Connects to Google News RSS feed\n",
    "- Searches for climate-related articles and headlines\n",
    "- Extracts the actual claim text from real news sources\n",
    "- Handles errors gracefully (if scraping fails, falls back to sample claims)\n",
    "- Respects rate limits and uses proper HTTP headers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- Instead of fake sample data, we're now processing REAL headlines\n",
    "- These are actual claims people are reading and sharing\n",
    "- You get immediate, current fact-checks\n",
    "- Perfect for understanding what misinformation is spreading RIGHT NOW\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fallback Logic:**\n",
    "- If live scraping works → Use real news claims ✅\n",
    "- If scraping fails → Use sample claims as backup ⚠️\n",
    "- Either way, you get claims to fact-check\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",
    "The scraper is polite:\n",
    "- Respects robots.txt\n",
    "- Uses proper User-Agent headers\n",
    "- Includes reasonable timeouts\n",
    "- Doesn't hammer servers with requests\n",
